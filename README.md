# sonsole README

This extension is useful for getting solutions to error messages on the go while writing the code. Hence this is helpful for novice programmers. The Sonsole extension not only gives stackoverflow answered queries but also provides context based tags so that the semantic search is available and thus manual search time for answers reduces. 

## Features

> Using the terminal capture command we can see the results from stackoverflow with the tags.
